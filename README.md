# SightStack Research

*Investigating problems at the boundaries of understanding*

SightStack Research is the independent think tank division of SightStack, dedicated to solving high-friction problems at the edges of logic, physics, perception, identity, and systems theory. We are not bound by academic silos or disciplinary borders. If it’s a contradiction, a blind spot, or an edge case—we study it.

### Purpose

To explore and expose foundational structures across reality using logic-based, cross-domain models. From quantum curvature to emotional resonance, we design frameworks that unify, clarify, or reframe where needed.

### Projects

* **DripKit** — This is a passion project. It is a Low-tech, modular, field-deployable water harvesting systems for areas without access to clean water sources. See PDF for more info. Website and kits available soon. 
* **Temporal Compression Model (TCM)** — A scalar-field solution that reconciles time treatment in quantum mechanics and general relativity  
* **Drift Cosmology** — A model of emotional and perceptual drift as field curvature
* **BoriSight** — A layered emotional visual analysis framework based on microexpression curvature and visual signal weight
* **TrueSight** — A framework for decoding identity-level truth in interpersonal logic systems
* **JobSight, CareerSight, MissionSight** — A suite of employer and employee focused emotional vector alignment tools for uncovering role fit, purpose orientation, and mission drift in business focus.
* **Color Dot Language (CDL)** — A nonverbal symbolic structure for emotional state transmission

### Philosophy

We don’t assume the variables are wrong—we assume the framework is incomplete. If an idea breaks under its own weight, we reframe it until it holds.
