# SightStack Research

*Investigating problems at the boundaries of understanding*

SightStack Research is the independent think tank division of SightStack, dedicated to solving high-friction problems at the edges of logic, physics, perception, identity, and systems theory. We are not bound by academic silos or disciplinary borders. If it’s a contradiction, a blind spot, or an edge case—we study it.

### Purpose

To explore and expose foundational structures across reality using logic-based, cross-domain models. From quantum curvature to emotional resonance, we design frameworks that unify, clarify, or reframe where needed.

### Projects

* **Temporal Compression Model (TCM)** — A scalar-field solution that reconciles time treatment in quantum mechanics and general relativity
* **Relational Drift Geometry** - A spatial and temporal framwork for measuring planar drift and distortion



### Philosophy

We don’t assume the variables are wrong—we assume the framework is incomplete. If an idea breaks under its own weight, we reframe it until it holds.
